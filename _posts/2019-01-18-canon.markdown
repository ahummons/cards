> "The EOS Rebel T6i does more, easier, making capturing photos and shooting videos a breeze. Its high-resolution 24.2 Megapixel CMOS (APS-C) sensor means finely detailed, crisp and natural-looking photographs. The VideoMic GO™ is a lightweight, easy to use, directional microphone that picks up clear audio in front of it, reducing surrounding sound and isolating your subject from background noise. The built-in shock mount reduces noise from handling and a foam windshield reduces wind noise. Mount the VideoMic GO™ on the camera's hotshoe, plug in the 1/8" (3.5mm) plug, insert the SDHC card and you're ready to start shooting!"--Manufacturer description.
